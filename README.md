# Milady Poland - Github connection page

This is a page for my Milady Maker NFT deriv where the holders can map their Github accounts to their NFT address and benefit from more custom metadata in their NFTs.

Link: https://github.miladypoland.com/

The user has to post a public gist with their connected wallet address and paste the link on the page.
